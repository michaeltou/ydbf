  Python projects, similar to YDbf
  --------------------------------
  
   * http://code.activestate.com/recipes/362715/ -- original code
     by Raymond Hettinger.
  
   * http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/pydbf -- DBF reader and writer.
     If you are familiar with Django, you may want to look at pydbf,
     because it's API for describing DBF structure looks similar
     to Django model API.
  
   * http://py-dbase.sourceforge.net -- reader and writer for DBF,
     by Greg Burnet. Gives high abstraction for DBF files, could read and write
     single records. Seems to be unsupported (last change in 2003).
  
   * http://www.fiby.at/dbfpy/ -- reader and writer for DBF, by Jeff Kunce and
     Hans Fiby. Looks similar to py-dbase. Seems to be unsupported (last change
     in 2001).
  
   * http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/software/python/dbfreader.py --
     reader for DBF files by Lars M. Garshol. dbfreader have an interesting
     feature -- it supports memo fields.
  
   * https://github.com/ethanfurman/dbf -- reader/writer in pure python by
     Ethan Furman, the library supports in-memory indexes.
